    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "We conisder problem of providing two-side quotes on financial markets (market-making or dealing). Problem is actual mostly for institutions who have obligations to support quotes for some instruments (liquidity provider) by placing bid and ask limit orders into limit order book (also known as Depth of Market). Dealer usually has to support both sides simulteneously during main trade session (full or part) with limit on maximum spread. The question is at what prices market-maker should place limit orders to maximize expected utility (profits) and minimize risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "From theoretical point of view it is stochastic optimal control problem and it is studies a lot starting from 1980s. Optimal strategy heavily depends on market microstructure properties and there are rather simple solutions in some cases. In this work we investigate market microstructure properties and test one realization of such market-maker strategy for Russian currency market (USD/RUB). We test this strategy and compare it with simplest possible strategy, when dealer places order at constant distance from mid price.\n",

    "We have researched microstructure propeties of Russian currency market by the USB/RUB example (most traded pair). We finds that distribution of volumes of large market orders follows power law with tail index equals to $2$. Also we find that distribution highly likely consists of several components, and estimation of these components separately provide similar results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We investigate relationship between average instant (virtual) price impact and market order size: it is linear for small-size orders and logarithmic for large-size ones. Analysis shown that mentioned above components have the same relationships. It is crucial for us because we interested first in large and often happen orders (like 500 lots).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have made simulations to test and compare results of benchmark equidistant strategy and strategy based on quasi-optimal Avellaneda-Stoikov model. We can conlude that advanced model has comparable mean profit and mean final inventory, but also sighnificantly less volatility of these metrics. Also it means that AS-model strategy is much less risky because of less chance of adverse inventory revaluation. The great advandantage of this model is its simplisity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to mention some drawbacks of our simulation process:\n",
    "1. Transaction costs are not included, but it is rather simple to include. It can affect model results dramatically if there size is higher than average profit a deal. It is fair to say that it is not issue of the AS-model only, it is an issue for any HFT market-making strategy.\n",
    "2. Partial execution of market orders. Touching the price by market order does not guarantee limit order execution. It is the substantial drawback in current simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further steps:\n",
    "1. Test on real market is logical next step to approve model applicability in real conditions.\n",
    "2. Improving model. It is possible to avoid some assumptions by solving PDE numerically. But the problem here is how to estimate model arrival rates $\\lambda(\\delta)$.\n",
    "3. Improve simulation with more complicated model of market microstructure. E.g. taking into account partial order execution which is the most weak point in simulation.\n",
    "3. Improve simulation with fractional Brownian motion instead of simple one.\n",
    "4. Taking into account transaction costs.\n"
